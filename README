Malva
=====

What is Malva?
--------------

Malva is a test suite for alternative JVMs. It tests core Java APIs such as
'java.lang' and 'java.lang.reflect' that require implementation on the JVM
side. The primary goal for Malva is to find compatibility problems in
alternative JVMs but its also useful as a regression test suite for JVM
developers.

The test cases look a lot like JUnit tests. We do not, however, use JUnit
because it relies on core APIs such as annotation support and reflection that
we want to test. Each test class is written as a standalone runnable class that
implements the main() method to make sure tests are as isolated as possible.
That should make pin-pointing the root cause of a bug easier to JVM developers.

Malva targets the Java 1.6 APIs as described in the API specification at:

Running the Test Suite
----------------------

To compile the test suite with 'javac' and run the tests with 'java' use:

  make check

All tests should pass.

If you want to use an alternative compiler or JVM pass the JAVAC and JAVA
options to make:

  make check JAVAC=ecj JAVA=cacao
